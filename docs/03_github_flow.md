### The Essential GitHub Workflow

The GitHub flow is a lightweight workflow that allows you to experiment with new ideas safely, without fear of compromising a project.

Branching is a key concept you will need to understand. Everything in GitHub lives on a branch. By default, the "blessed" or "canonical" version of your project lives on a branch called `main`.

As you make changes to the files within the project, you will commit your changes to the feature branch.

When you are ready to start a discussion about your changes, you will open a pull request. A pull request doesn't need to be a perfect work of art - it is meant to be a starting point that will be further refined and polished through the efforts of the project team.

When the changes contained in the pull request are approved, the feature branch is merged onto the main branch. In the next section, you will learn how to put this GitHub workflow into practice.
