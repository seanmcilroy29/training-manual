### The Essential GitHub Workflow

The GitHub flow is a lightweight workflow that allows you to experiment with new ideas safely, without fear of compromising a project.

**Branching** 

When you're working on a project, you're going to have a bunch of different features or ideas in progress at any given time â€“ some of which are ready to go, and others which are not. Branching exists to help you manage this workflow.

Top Tip
Branching is a core concept in Git, and the entire GitHub flow is based upon it. There's only one rule: anything in the main branch is always deployable.

Because of this, it's extremely important that your new branch is created off of main when working on a feature or a fix. Your branch name should be descriptive (e.g., refactor-authentication, user-content-cache-key, make-retina-avatars), so that others can see what is being worked on.
