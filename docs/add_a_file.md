## Add a File

Unless you have the right permission, you won’t be able to upload a file directly to the VFA repository. 
These are the possible options:

### A. Create an empty file as a placeholder, then copy and paste the content into the new file

1. Choose a branch and click **Create new file**
1. Complete file name, title, content & description
1. Click **Propose new file**
1. Click **Create a pull request**
```Note: Make sure that you choose the correct destination branch```
1. Select the recently created Pull Request
1. Select the tab Files changed and click in **(…)** and then click **Edit File**
1. Copy and paste content

### B. Add a File – Use your Personal GitHub Client (Desktop)

1. GitHub Desktop
     It is a tool that allows you to interact with GitHub.com from your desktop
     There are multiple apps. GitHub Desktop is simple, free and it can be downloaded from 
     [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop).
1. Personal GitHub.com account
     If you have a GitHub account, you have one, check https://github.com/<your-user-mame>
     Here you will find all the repositories that you have forked
1. Working Directory
     You clone repositories to your hard drive
     Please remember to store them in a folder that it is not synced with the cloud. You may have problems otherwise; this is because each time that you change from branch to branch the content in the folder changes.
1. Visual Studio Code
     There are multiple editors, Visual Studio Code is a free source-code editor,  which features will 
     assist you in your editing work. It can be downloaded [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
     
- Current Repository Repository that it is currently uploaded to the tool
You can select any of the forked repos, clone, create new or add existing ones
The tool will automatically fork a repo if you start a Pull Request in a repo where you don’t have write access.
- **Changes (tab)** From here you can decide how you are going to work with the files: using an external editor, open them in your Finder or Explorer or in GitHub
- **History (tab)** All the changes applied to the repo
- **Current Branch**
- **Origin** Normally it refers to repos in your Personal GitHub.com account 
- **Upstream** Normally it refers to repos in OMP GitHub.com account
- **Fork** When a repo in OMP GitHub.com account is copied to your Personal GitHub.com account
- **Clone** When a repo is copied to the working directory in your laptop (local)
